# coral_bleaching_mini_project

Coral bleaching simulations for Systems Biology Part III mini-project assessment

For our week-long mini-project, we have decided to model coral bleaching on both individual and population levels. 

We have used the following techniques:

1. Boolean modelling using the BMA software
2. Flux balance analysis using the Cobra package
3. Deterministic modelling 
4. Stochastic ecological model 
5. Particle-based simulation using Smoldyn
